SciPy User Guide
#
SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built
on
NumPy
. It adds significant power to Python by providing the user with
high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.
Subpackages and User Guides
#
SciPy is organized into subpackages covering different scientific
computing domains. These are summarized in the following table, with
their user guide linked in the Description and User Guide column (if available):
Subpackage
Description and User Guide
cluster

integrate
Integration (scipy.integrate)
interpolate
Interpolation (scipy.interpolate)
io
File IO (scipy.io)
linalg
